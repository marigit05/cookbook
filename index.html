        Growing up in a kitchen between and pots and pans, I got to know 
        my mom's cooking skills as a child. I was always there, baking pizzas, peeling tomatoes, 
  
        filleting fish ... My Sicilian roots are unmistakable when my friends see me cooking (I am German in other ways, yes). 
        I have always been asked why I eat so much tomatoes .. I can't imagine a life without tomatoes (Friends of mine from the North of Italy have never
        cooked an aubergine which is very uncommon for me).

        One of the most important aspects of may way of cooking is 
        just the simple use of combining ingredients. 
        Using fresh, high-quality ingredients will result in
        a better-tasting dish: The intense taste of fresh tomatoes 
        and basil when preparing a tomato salsa, the combination of 
        sweet and sour with veg, the smell of grilled artichokes, the strong smell of fennel
        in delicious tomato sauce, orange sliced salad with black olives.The list
        is never ending with fresh, regional products.</canvas>
